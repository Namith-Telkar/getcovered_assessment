# Event Loop Fix - Summary

## The Problem

```
ERROR: asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop
RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'AuthDetector._detect_with_playwright' was never awaited
```

## Root Cause

FastAPI runs inside an async event loop. When `detect_auth_components()` tried to call `asyncio.run()` for Playwright, it attempted to create a **nested event loop**, which is not allowed in Python's asyncio.

## The Fix

### 1. **Modified `scraper.py`**

Changed from:

```python
if self._needs_playwright(url):
    return asyncio.run(self._detect_with_playwright(url))  # ❌ BAD
```

To:

```python
if self._needs_playwright(url):
    return self._detect_with_playwright(url)  # ✅ GOOD - return coroutine
```

### 2. **Modified `main.py`**

Added coroutine detection and proper awaiting:

```python
@app.post("/analyze")
async def analyze_url(request: URLRequest):
    # Get result (might be coroutine or dict)
    static_result = detector.detect_auth_components(request.url)

    # Check if result is a coroutine (Playwright mode)
    import inspect
    if inspect.iscoroutine(static_result):
        static_result = await static_result  # ✅ Await in existing event loop
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Regular sites**: `detect_auth_components()` returns a dict immediately
2. **JS-heavy sites** (Instagram, etc.): `detect_auth_components()` returns a coroutine
3. **FastAPI endpoint**: Checks result type and awaits if necessary

## Testing

Run the test script:

```bash
cd backend
python3 test_instagram.py
```

Or test via API:

```bash
# Start server
uvicorn main:app --reload

# In another terminal
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://www.instagram.com/accounts/login/"}'
```

## Why This Solution Works

✅ **No nested event loops** - We reuse FastAPI's existing event loop  
✅ **Backward compatible** - Regular sites still work with sync code  
✅ **Flexible** - Handles both sync and async detection automatically  
✅ **Clean** - No need to make all detection async

## Files Changed

- `scraper.py` - Removed `asyncio.run()`, return coroutine directly
- `main.py` - Added coroutine detection with `inspect.iscoroutine()`
- `test_instagram.py` - New test script for verification
